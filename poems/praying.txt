Praying
by Mary Oliver
.
It doesn't have to be
the blue iris, it could be
weeds in a vacant lot, or a few
small stones; just
pay attention, then patch
.
a few words together and don't try
to make them elaborate, this isn't
a contest but the doorway
.
into thanks, and a silence in which
another voice may speak.

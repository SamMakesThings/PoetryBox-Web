Sidewalks stretch like ribbons, gray and vast,
Through the heart of San Francisco, holding fast.
Each slab a story, etched with worn-out shoes,
Of dreamers chasing fog, their paths to choose.

Morning mist cloaks the city's waking yawn,
As joggers pace by lawns dew-kissed till dawn.
Cafes spill laughter, clinks of cups on plates,
While streetcars hum tunes that the breeze dictates.

Evening brings shadows, stretching long and thin,
San Francisco sidewalks, where hearts wander in.
